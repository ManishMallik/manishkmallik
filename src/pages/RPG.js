                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>Project: Developed in ACM Projects</p>
                <p>Tech Stack: Figma, Flutter, Firebase, Dart, Google Maps API</p>
                <p>Role: Frontend Developer, UI/UX Designer</p>

                <h1>Purpose/Prompt</h1>
                <p>Unsure if youâ€™re ready to handle the responsibility of a pet? This app simulates life with a pet to 
                see if bringing home a furry friend is the right decision for you and your family!</p>
                <br/>
                <h1>Process</h1>
                <p>To start this project, me and my friends had to understand the prompt and analyze the goals in order
                to achieve that purpose. We also had to analyze what our audience would consist of. We deduced that most
                of the people that want a pet but do not fully know how to take care of one would be young kids.</p>
                <br/>
                <h1>Solution</h1>
                <p>Our solution was to create an application that would simulate the life and responsibilities of handling
                a pet.
